The Path of the Berserker is detailed at the end of the class description, and additional primal paths are available in other sources. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Fast Movement</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Feral Instinct</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{incapacitated}, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Brutal Critical</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Relentless Rage</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Persistent Rage</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{unconscious} or if you choose to end it.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Indomitable Might</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Primal Champion</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.</span></p>\n\n<h1>Starting Equipment</h1>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a greataxe or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) any martial melee weapon</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) two handaxes or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) any simple weapon</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">An explorer’s pack and four javelins</li>\n</ul>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 46, Basic Rules pg 49","identifier":"barbarian","levels":6,"hitDice":"d12","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"RAZq12DjKDg7Z6el","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"GtTZy3gEucS3aoMK","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"distance":{"units":""},"identifier":"rage","type":"numeric","scale":{"1":{"value":2},"9":{"value":3},"16":{"value":4}}},"value":{},"title":"Rage","icon":""},{"_id":"62svnflxsuad7oar","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"rages","type":"number","scale":{"1":{"value":2},"3":{"value":3},"6":{"value":4},"12":{"value":5},"17":{"value":6},"20":{"value":999}}},"value":{},"title":"Rages","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"t42incolsbuqn2ec","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"rage-damage","type":"number","scale":{"1":{"value":2},"9":{"value":3},"16":{"value":4}}},"value":{},"title":"Rage Damage","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"y0kr48pnq5doebeb","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"brutal-critical","type":"number","scale":{"9":{"value":1},"13":{"value":2},"17":{"value":3}}},"value":{},"title":"Brutal Critical Dice","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["str","con"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","nat","ani","prc","sur","itm"],"value":["prc","ath"]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":120561507,"definitionId":9,"entityTypeId":1446578651,"type":"class","importId":"0jKb0q6ukCUshxkw"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Barbarian"}},"core":{"sourceId":"Actor.e6jebZKAPmUzhEDT.Item.gmMvlTzCFuloJpT0"}},"img":"icons/skills/melee/hand-grip-sword-orange.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":106250,"ownership":{"default":0,"8pEKuxhCYVCDuXDE":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1671794610709,"modifiedTime":1672860620842,"lastModifiedBy":"8pEKuxhCYVCDuXDE"},"_id":"z0a52ifm6LRRxtqq"}
