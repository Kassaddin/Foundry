Недавно стукнуло 27, но выглядит старше своих лет. Всегда молчалив и задумчив, говорит тихо, предпочитает общаться знаками. Знает, когда нужно взять, а когда - отдать. Выгоды не упустит, но не во вред другим. Родился в деревушке близ Невервинтера. Мать умерла при родах, поэтому рос с отцом. Тот был кузнецом и часто ездил с Йориком в Невервинтер на рынок, где продавал свои изделия. Йорика никогда не привлекало дело отца, но он исправно помогал ему во всем. В свободное от дел время он брал доспехи и оружие из кузни и упражнялся в фехтовании. Как-то раз к отцу Йорика приехал его старый друг Орэн, служивший наёмником в одной торговой гильдии. Он прибыл с караваном в Невервинтер и решил заглянуть к своему товарищу. Увидев тягу Йорика к оружию, он решил дать пару уроков. Движения подростка были быстры и сильны, но видна была их неумелость. Орэн, видя рвения сына своего друга, предложил тому взять Йорика в ученики. Так началась его новая жизнь, полная опасностей и приключений. Многое произошло за то время. Орэн стал вторым отцом Йорику. Он обучал его как оружию, так и рассказывал при мир вокруг них. Йорик возмужал и стал отлично владеть как мечом, так щитом, сделанным для него отцом. Окованный тусклой сталью, потрепанный во многих боях, наполовину черный - наполовину белый. В одном из походов они везли особо ценный груз во Врата Балдура. На их несчастье, впереди их ждала крупная засада. Завязался ожесточенный бой. Груз был спасен, но не все его защитники. Среди тел разбойников лежало одно. Оно улыбалось Йорику кровавой улыбкой. Взгляд потух и на том был конец Орэна. Стоя перед керном своего второго отца, Йорик осознал, что все еще не знает, чего жаждет и к чему стремится. Он знал одно: в его левой руке - щит родного отца, а в правой - меч названного. Теперь он знал, как огромен мир, и сколько всего еще ему предстоит познать. Проведя мечем в воздухе от керна к звездному небу, он тихо произнес: \"Я найду свой путь\".\nЗавершив сопровождение груза, он решил взять перерыв и все обдумать. Он понял, что был в Вотердипе только мельком, хотя этот город так расхваливал Орэн. Основательно отдохнув и пережив утрату, он отправился в путь, полный решимости исследовать все земли Фаеруна.</p><h2>Folk Hero</h2><p>You come from a humble social rank, but you are destined for so much more.

@Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Survival}</p>\n\n<p><b>Rage</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{unconscious} or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Defense</b></p>\n<p>While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Reckless Attack</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Danger Sense</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{blinded}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{deafened}, or @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{incapacitated}.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Primal Path</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{nature} of your rage. The Path of the Berserker is detailed at the end of the class description, and additional primal paths are available in other sources. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Fast Movement</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Feral Instinct</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{incapacitated}, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Brutal Critical</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Relentless Rage</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5.

I still have the damnable sting blisters from their catapults. WASPS! WHAT CREATURE PUTS WASPS IN BAGS AND THROWS THEM AT YOU?! Next Kobold I see I'm turning to paste…\"<br />- Guard Captain Nathaniel Greenbow, interviewed for this bestiary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Kobolds are conniving, cowardly humanoids of a reptilian appearance who infest the dungeons, catacombs, and caverns of our world. Appearing as tiny dragonoids with scaled flesh and crocodile-like snouts, Kobolds are perhaps more clever than their outward appearance would lead one to believe. Within their tiny heads (as the creatures stand no more than two and a half feet tall) lies a brain churning with myriad ideas, though many include idiotically dangerous schemes. It is not uncommon for many Kobolds to perish before their first complete decade of life.</p>\n<p><strong>Mob Mentality.</strong> Kobolds, much like rodents, breed at an astonishingly quick rate as compared to other humanoid species. Egg-layers like their draconic kin, Kobolds mature rapidly upon emerging from their shells, and assume their place within the ranks of their chittering society. Even upon reaching maturity, however, the Kobold is still a weak creature causing the colonies to stick together when exploring or hunting. Though Kobolds may defeat larger foes with sheer numbers, it is often at the cost of massive casualties on the Kobold's side. This, of course, hardly deters the resentful Kobolds, who have more eggs incubating away with the next infantry reinforcements just moments away from joining the fold.</p>\n<p><strong>Launch the Centipult.</strong> Stupid yet clever, Kobolds truly excel at two things: burrow-making and creating traps for unwary adventurers. Traps, of course, are the Kobold's speciality and they take relish in littering their lairs with copious defenses hewn from the natural resources of their home. Perhaps crushing logs were torn from the rafter struts of an abandoned temple, or carnivorous insects were placed into dropping ceramic pots to smash down upon foolish intruders. Never underestimate the ability of a Kobold to find some unsuspected way to impede your progress.</p>\n<p><strong>Trade Offs.</strong> Though strong in numbers, Kobolds may be defeated in several ways. Firstly, the creatures are born and mature within near total darkness, thus the sun weakens them and blinds their sensitive eyes. Kobolds are also nigh defenseless without the aid of their allies at their backs; often a lone Kobold with attempt to scurry away should they be caught out without their pack. Greedy and determined when it comes to self-preservation, Kobolds may be easily manipulated with smooth talk or a shiny trinket to line their pockets. Draconic in nature as well, the scuttling dragonoids can be used as crude translators of the dragon's tongue should you require such services on your journey.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.Ye5f3FReEnuXfi0y]{School of Evocation}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"wizard","levels":6,"hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"9ojqd2dejdsffabi","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.gbNo5eVPaqr8IVKL","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.e0uTcFPpgxjIyUW9"]},"value":{"added":{"z6jSpa9Rj9fOigJx":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.gbNo5eVPaqr8IVKL","Uvvuud4mHQBxbqzG":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.e0uTcFPpgxjIyUW9"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"o0xix805mucymjbt","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.AEWr9EMxy5gj4ZFT"]},"value":{"added":{"IuxRClPy7i8TUUfX":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.AEWr9EMxy5gj4ZFT"}},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"sg6rj5gth6ljcbkg","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.JfFfHTeIszx1hNRx"]},"value":{},"level":18,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"hoi88xqc3e5je60f","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nUrZDi6QN1YjwAr6","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.31bKbWe9ZGVLEns6"]},"value":{},"level":20,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"6x1gwvf02qraedhe","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":5,"3":4,"4":4,"5":6,"6":5},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"8pEKuxhCYVCDuXDE":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1661787234283,"modifiedTime":1672153986284,"lastModifiedBy":"8pEKuxhCYVCDuXDE"}},{"name":"Darkvision","type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"You can see in darkness (shades of gray) up to 60 ft.\n<details>\n  <summary>\n    More Details\n  </summary>\n  <p>\n    </p><p>Thanks to your elf blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.

See <span style=\"color:#99cc00\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color:#993366\"><a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"Spells Listing (Wizard)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=8&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span> for the wizard spell list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellbook</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color:#47d18c\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{nature} of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">The Book’s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n</blockquote>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Wizard","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"cover":null,"crewed":false,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"","subtype":""},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":410,"type":"class","dndbeyond":{"requiredLevel":1,"displayOrder":3,"levelScale":null,"levelScales":[],"limitedUse":[],"class":"Wizard"},"class":"Wizard","subclass":"School of Evocation","importId":"C0H1BqCk190lavnK"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Wizard"}}},"img":"icons/magic/light/projectiles-star-purple.webp","effects":[],"_id":"MTXBNoIKXy3todxF","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"8pEKuxhCYVCDuXDE":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1671985870038,"modifiedTime":1671985870038,"lastModifiedBy":"8pEKuxhCYVCDuXDE"}},{"name":"Arcane Tradition","type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation.

It ends early if you are knocked @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{unconscious} or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Defense</b></p>\n<p>While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Reckless Attack</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Danger Sense</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells.

If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Persistent Rage</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{unconscious} or if you choose to end it.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Indomitable Might</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Primal Champion</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds.

When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Your group can’t become lost except by magical means.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Fighting Style</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. </p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{nature} to cast spells, much as a druid does. See <span style=\"color:#99cc00\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color:#993366\"><a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"Spells Listing (Ranger)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=5&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span> for the ranger spell list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spell Slots</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">animal friendship</span> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">animal friendship</span> using either slot.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{nature}. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n\n<p><b>Ranger Archetype</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: the Hunter that is detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Primeval Awareness</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn’t reveal the creatures’ location or number.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Land’s Stride</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">entangle</span> spell.</p>\n\n<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (@Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Stealth}) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Vanish</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.</p>\n\n<p><b>Feral Senses</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can’t see. When you attack a creature you can’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You are also aware of the location of any @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{invisible} creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren’t @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{blinded} or @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{deafened}.</p>\n\n<p><b>Foe Slayer</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.</p>\n\n<h1>Starting Equipment</h1>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) scale mail or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) leather armor</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) two shortswords or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) two simple melee weapons</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a dungeoneer’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">A longbow and a quiver of 20 arrows</li>\n</ul>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 89, Basic Rules pg 93","identifier":"ranger","levels":6,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"N60a1p8PNE5JCi4z","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["str","dex"],"skills":{"number":3,"choices":["ath","ste","inv","nat","ani","ins","prc","sur"],"value":["ani","prc","sur"]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"wis"}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":119315484,"definitionId":5,"entityTypeId":1446578651,"type":"class","spellSlotDivisor":2,"spellCastingAbility":"wis","importId":"dTc1Cx2DF1n8xgqx"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Ranger"}}},"img":"icons/weapons/bows/shortbow-recurve-yellow.webp","effects":[],"_id":"B6o4wFMu6qIqgKwq","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"8pEKuxhCYVCDuXDE":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1671571840327,"modifiedTime":1671571840327,"lastModifiedBy":"8pEKuxhCYVCDuXDE"}},{"name":"Mountain Dwarf","type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal.</p>\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family:Roboto Condensed\"><strong>Racial Traits</strong><br />+2 Constitution, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.eVtpEGXjA2tamEIJ]{Darkvision}, Dwarven Resilience, Dwarven Combat Training, Stonecunning</p><p>As a mountain dwarf, you’re strong and hardy, accustomed to a difficult life in rugged terrain.

They have language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are the races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Ranger","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"cover":null,"crewed":false,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"","subtype":""},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":294,"type":"class","dndbeyond":{"requiredLevel":1,"displayOrder":3,"levelScale":null,"levelScales":[],"limitedUse":[],"choice":{"label":"Humanoids","choiceId":"3-533062-259293394","componentId":294,"componentTypeId":12168134,"parentChoiceId":null,"subType":null,"wasOption":false,"type":"class"},"class":"Ranger"},"class":"Ranger","subclass":"Hunter","importId":"dTc1Cx2DF1n8xgqx"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Ranger"}}},"img":"icons/magic/acid/dissolve-bone-skull.webp","effects":[],"_id":"ph7A9GFapMdtfLEK","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"8pEKuxhCYVCDuXDE":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1671571840367,"modifiedTime":1671571840367,"lastModifiedBy":"8pEKuxhCYVCDuXDE"}},{"name":"Favored Enemy: Orcs","type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead.

gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object – an amulet or similar adornment – that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.</p>\n<p>Your totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in place of an eagle.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Bear:</span> While raging, you have resistance to all damage except <strong>psychic</strong> damage. The spirit of the bear makes you tough enough to stand up to any punishment.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Eagle:</span> While you're raging and aren't wearing heavy armor, other creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn. The spirit of the eagle makes you into a predator who can weave through the fray with ease.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Elk:</span> While you're raging and aren't wearing heavy armor, your walking speed increases by <strong>15 feet</strong>. The spirit of the elk makes you extraordinarily swift.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Tiger:</span> While raging, you can add <strong>10 feet </strong>to your long jump distance and <strong>3 feet </strong>to your high jump distance. The spirit of the tiger empowers your leaps.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Wolf:</span> While you're raging, your friends have advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature within<strong> 5 feet </strong>of you that is hostile to you. The spirit of the wolf makes you a leader of hunters.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Penguin:</span> While raging, you have immunity to <strong>cold </strong>damage, and any ally within <strong>10 feet </strong>of you gains resistance to <strong>cold</strong> damage. Additionally, whenever you are raging, you may use the Disengage action as a bonus action. Any ally within <strong>5 ft.</strong> of you may also use the Disengage action as a bonus action, so long as you are free to use your reaction to shove them.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Goat:</span> While raging, you gain a ram attack. Your unarmed strike deals [[/r 1d6]] <strong>bludgeoning</strong> damage. If you hit a Larger or smaller creature with a melee weapon attack while raging, you can make a shove attempt against the target as a bonus action. The spirit of the goat makes you headstrong and hard to stand against.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Lion:</span> While raging, and not incapacitated, creatures can't have advantage on attack rolls against you if there is at least one ally that's not incapacitated and is within <strong>5 feet</strong> of the attacker.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Monkey:</span> While raging, wielding a versatile weapon with one weapon counts as if you are wielding it with both hands (but only for the sake of calculating versatile damage). Alternatively, you can wield a two-handed weapon with only one hand, but you can't use more than one two-handed weapon at a time this way. If your size is small, you have no disadvantage when attacking with heavy weapons while raging, but you must use both hands to wield them. The spirit of the monkey gives you an unmatched grasp.</li>\n</ul>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Super's Pack","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"cover":null,"crewed":false,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"","subtype":""},"requirements":"Totem Barbarian 3","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672860080800,"modifiedTime":1672860327757,"lastModifiedBy":"8pEKuxhCYVCDuXDE"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"8pEKuxhCYVCDuXDE":3},"_id":"Mul4wusf0NSd3qwD"},{"name":"Charge","type":"feat","img":"icons/creatures/mammals/ox-bull-horned-glowing-orange.webp","system":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\" id=\"secret-LXQ11NGdH9wAB5iL\"><p>If Ram moves at least 20 ft. straight toward a target and then rams into it, the target takes an extra<strong> 2d4 </strong><em><strong>bludgeoning</strong></em><strong> </strong><em><strong>damage</strong></em>.</p><p>If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a <strong>DC 13 Strength</strong> saving throw or be knocked prone.</p></section>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"cover":null,"crewed":false,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":20,"long":null,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":"","recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"other","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[["1d6","slashing"]],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"str","dc":11,"scaling":"flat"},"type":{"value":"","subtype":""},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"attunement":0},"effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Actor.jQdGuefAnQTzY6V1.Item.TSmET06nE61H6HC2"},"cf":{"id":"temp_ww20xbi2fh"},"midi-qol":{"effectActivation":false},"midiProperties":{"nodam":false,"fulldam":false,"halfdam":false,"autoFailFriendly":false,"rollOther":false,"critOther":false,"offHandWeapon":false,"magicdam":false,"magiceffect":false,"concentration":false,"toggleEffect":false,"ignoreTotalCover":false},"magicitems":{"enabled":false,"equipped":false,"attuned":false,"charges":"0","chargeType":"c1","destroy":false,"destroyFlavorText":"reaches 0 charges: it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","rechargeable":false,"recharge":"0","rechargeType":"t1","rechargeUnit":"r1","sorting":"l"},"favtab":{"isFavorite":true}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672860367960,"modifiedTime":1672860592443,"lastModifiedBy":"8pEKuxhCYVCDuXDE"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"8pEKuxhCYVCDuXDE":3},"_id":"KoeXGzlGQmzNOElA"},{"name":"Barbarian","type":"class","system":{"description":{"value":"<h1>Description</h1><p>A fierce warrior of primitive background who can enter a battle rage</p>\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family:Roboto Condensed;font-size:14px\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d12<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong> Strength<br /><strong>Saves:</strong> Strength &amp;

On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{unconscious} or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Defense</b></p>\n<p>While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Reckless Attack</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Danger Sense</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{blinded}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{deafened}, or @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{incapacitated}.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Primal Path</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{nature} of your rage. The Path of the Berserker is detailed at the end of the class description, and additional primal paths are available in other sources. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Fast Movement</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Feral Instinct</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{incapacitated}, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Brutal Critical</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Relentless Rage</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Persistent Rage</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{unconscious} or if you choose to end it.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Indomitable Might</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Primal Champion</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds.

You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.</span></p>\n<h5><b>Spell Slots</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.</span></p>\n<h5><b>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</span></p>\n<h5><b>Spellcasting Ability</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{performance} of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</span></p>\n<p><b>Spell save DC </b><span style=\"font-weight:400\">= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</span></p>\n<p><b>Spell attack modifier </b><span style=\"font-weight:400\">= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</span></p>\n<h5><b>Ritual Casting</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</span></p>\n<h5><b>Spellcasting Focus</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You can use a musical instrument (see the <a style=\"color:#47d18c\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#Tools\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Tools</span></a> section) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Bardic Inspiration</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Jack of All Trades</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn’t already include your proficiency bonus.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Song of Rest</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{performance} regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Bard College</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice: the College of Lore detailed at the end of the class description or another from the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Player's Handbook</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> or other sources. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Expertise</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Font of Inspiration</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Countercharm</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{performance} that lasts until the end of your next turn.

I still have the damnable sting blisters from their catapults. WASPS! WHAT CREATURE PUTS WASPS IN BAGS AND THROWS THEM AT YOU?! Next Kobold I see I'm turning to paste…\"<br />- Guard Captain Nathaniel Greenbow, interviewed for this bestiary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Kobolds are conniving, cowardly humanoids of a reptilian appearance who infest the dungeons, catacombs, and caverns of our world. Appearing as tiny dragonoids with scaled flesh and crocodile-like snouts, Kobolds are perhaps more clever than their outward appearance would lead one to believe. Within their tiny heads (as the creatures stand no more than two and a half feet tall) lies a brain churning with myriad ideas, though many include idiotically dangerous schemes. It is not uncommon for many Kobolds to perish before their first complete decade of life.</p>\n<p><strong>Mob Mentality.</strong> Kobolds, much like rodents, breed at an astonishingly quick rate as compared to other humanoid species. Egg-layers like their draconic kin, Kobolds mature rapidly upon emerging from their shells, and assume their place within the ranks of their chittering society. Even upon reaching maturity, however, the Kobold is still a weak creature causing the colonies to stick together when exploring or hunting. Though Kobolds may defeat larger foes with sheer numbers, it is often at the cost of massive casualties on the Kobold's side. This, of course, hardly deters the resentful Kobolds, who have more eggs incubating away with the next infantry reinforcements just moments away from joining the fold.</p>\n<p><strong>Launch the Centipult.</strong> Stupid yet clever, Kobolds truly excel at two things: burrow-making and creating traps for unwary adventurers. Traps, of course, are the Kobold's speciality and they take relish in littering their lairs with copious defenses hewn from the natural resources of their home. Perhaps crushing logs were torn from the rafter struts of an abandoned temple, or carnivorous insects were placed into dropping ceramic pots to smash down upon foolish intruders. Never underestimate the ability of a Kobold to find some unsuspected way to impede your progress.</p>\n<p><strong>Trade Offs.</strong> Though strong in numbers, Kobolds may be defeated in several ways. Firstly, the creatures are born and mature within near total darkness, thus the sun weakens them and blinds their sensitive eyes. Kobolds are also nigh defenseless without the aid of their allies at their backs; often a lone Kobold with attempt to scurry away should they be caught out without their pack. Greedy and determined when it comes to self-preservation, Kobolds may be easily manipulated with smooth talk or a shiny trinket to line their pockets. Draconic in nature as well, the scuttling dragonoids can be used as crude translators of the dragon's tongue should you require such services on your journey.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by
