{"name":"Tabaxi","type":"feat","img":"user/misc/tabaxi.png","system":{"description":{"value":"<h1>Tabaxi</h1><p><span style=\"font-family:'Open Sans', sans-serif\">Hailing from a strange and distant land, wandering tabaxi are catlike humanoids driven by curiosity to collect interesting artifacts, record stories and tales, and view all the wonders in the world. Notorious travelers, inquisitive tabaxi rarely settle in one place for a long time. Their innate nature pushes them to uncover mysteries and find lost treasures and legends.</span></p><h2>Wandering vagabonds</h2><p>Most tabaxi remain in their distant homeland, living in small, close-knit clans. These tabaxi hunt, craft, and largely keep themselves in a circle of their own kind.</p><p>However, not all tabaxi are satisfied with such a life. The Cat God, the deity who created the tabaxi, endowed each of his children with one typically feline trait.</p><p>Tabaxi, endowed with curiosity, tend to wander everywhere. They collect stories, artifacts and knowledge. Those who survive this period of wanderlust return home in their mature years to share news of the outside world. In this way, the tabaxi remain isolated but always aware of the world outside their home.</p><h2>Fleeting hobbies</h2><p>Wandering tabaxi are fickle creatures, exchanging one obsession or passion for another on a fleeting whim. Tabaxi's desires flare up brightly, but in a moment disappear, replaced by a new obsession. The target captures them only as long as there is a mystery in it.</p><p>A Tabaxi rogue can happily spend months concocting a plan to steal an unusual gem from a noble, then trade it for a ship ticket or lodging a week after the theft. Tabaxi can take extensive notes or memorize every facet of a gem before handing it over, but the gem ceases to fascinate him once its secrets and nature have been revealed.</p><h2>Knowledge exchange</h2><p>Tabaxi value knowledge, not material things. A chest filled with gold coins might come in handy to buy food or a coil of rope, but it's not really interesting.</p><p>In the eyes of a tabaxi, accumulating wealth is like gathering supplies for a long trip. It is necessary to survive in the world, but do not worry about it. Instead, tabaxi value knowledge and new experiences. Their ears prick up in a full tavern, and they inquire about stories, offering food, drink, and coins.</p><p>Tabaxi may walk away with an empty wallet, but he mulls over the stories and rumors he's gathered like a miser counts coins.</p><p>Although material wealth means little to the tabaxi, they have a lust for finding and examining ancient relics, magical items, and other rare objects. In addition to the value such items can provide, tabaxi take great joy in unraveling the stories behind their creation and use.</p><h2>Merchants and ministrels</h2><p>Curiosity drives most tabaxi encountered outside their homeland, but not all of them become adventurous. Tabaxi, seeking a safer way to satisfy their obsessions, become itinerant traders and minstrels.</p><p>These tabaxi work in small troupes, usually consisting of an older, more experienced tabaxi who leads up to four younger ones who are learning their place in the world. They travel in small, colorful wagons that move from settlement to settlement. When they arrive, they set up a small stage in the town square where they sing, play instruments, tell stories, and offer exotic goods in exchange for items that pique their interest. Tabaxi are reluctant to accept gold, preferring interesting items or knowledge as payment.</p><p>These wanderers stick to the civilized kingdoms, preferring to trade rather than follow the more dangerous paths to satisfy their curiosity. However, they do not hesitate to do a little discreet theft in order to obtain a particularly interesting item that the owner refuses to sell or trade.</p><h2>Tabaxi Names</h2><p>Each tabaxi has one clan-given name based on a complex formula that includes astrology, divination, clan history, and other esoteric factors. Tabaxi names can refer to both males and females, most using nicknames derived from or inspired by full names.</p><p>Clan names are usually based on a geographic landmark located on or near the clan's territory. In the given examples of tabaxi names, nicknames are given in parentheses.</p><p><strong>Tabaxi Names:</strong> Left-Handed Hummingbird (Bird), Jade Shoe (Jade), Mountaintop Cloud (Cloud), Five Logs (Log), Seven Thunderclouds (Thunderstorm), Misty Mirror (Fog), Snake Skirt (Snake).</p><p><strong>Tabaxi Clans:</strong> Thundering River, Mountain Tree, Distant Rain, Snarling Mountain, Bright Cliffs.</p><p></p><h2>Tabaxi Traits</h2><p>Your tabaxi character has the following racial traits.</p><p><em><strong>Increasing performance.</strong></em> Your <strong>Dexterity score increases by 2</strong> and your <strong>Charisma score increases by 1</strong>.</p><p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Tabaxi have the same life expectancy <strong>as humans</strong>.</p><p><em><strong>Worldview.</strong></em> Any.</p><p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Tabaxi are on average taller than humans and relatively thin.
