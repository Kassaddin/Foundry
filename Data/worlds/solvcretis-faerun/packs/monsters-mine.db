Please use the rules for “Swarms” befitting your particular game system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ah yes, a personal favorite of this author, the raven is a singularly noble and clever bird vested in a shroud of twilight.  The ebony feathered bird reaches height of nearly two and a half feet tall and bears a thick, dark beak which is perfectly utilized in its scavenging diet of carrion, unattended grains, and insects.  However, something truly special lurks behind the dark abyss of this bird's eyes.  Should you be prepared, adventurer, the effort put into training the raven will be given back tenfold.</p>\n<p><strong>Musings and Mimicry. </strong> Ravens are unique specimens among birds; by listening intently and practicing often the raven is able to mimic sounds it hears perfectly.  From noises of forest animals to the precise timbre of their master's call, ravens are among the most seamless mimics to be found in the animal kingdom.  Truly adventurer, the possibilities to employ the raven's mimicry are nearly limitless!  You may see another example of this perfect mimicry in a larger cousin to this bird as well: the humanoid Kenku.  Raven-like in form these little humanoids share the feathers and large beaks of their brethren, as well as their ability to copy the sounds of the world around them.  Consider a second listen when you hear a voice but cannot place its location, for perhaps the raven speaks from the rafters above you, upon a midnight dreary.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope

body.  Atop the spider's tiny head are eight glistening eyes with which it views the world in relative obscurity.  While the spider's eyesight may be poor regardless of the number of eyes, they have a clever trick up their sleeves: the spider's web!</p>\n<p><strong>Some Bug.</strong> Ingenious little architects, spiders produce a silken thread from their rears dubbed “webbing” which they use to construct elaborate homes.  Resembling something of a net, the spider's web serves a dual purpose: to capture food upon its sticky surface and to give the spider a safe place to perch away from predators.  Once an insect is trapped within the web, the spider quickly wraps the unsuspecting creature in a bundle of webbing, saving its prize for later consumption.  While all spiders are venomous in some capacity, many will not be harmful to the adventurer on their travels.  Simply avoid webs where you see them and be quite sure that the web which you see only belongs to a standard spider species, as a plethora of gigantic and magical varieties also lurk within similar webs!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope

threat.  Hailing from a group of creatures called goblinoids (which includes bugbears and hobgoblins), the goblin is a foul humanoid measuring no larger than the average halfling.  Goblins have skin tones varying from light clay to deep chestnut brown to a sickly, acidic green, their hair is thin and greasy, and within their jaws rest cracked and sharpened teeth.  Together with their foaming fellows, goblins form loose collectives or tribes so their power can stand pronounced in numbers.  The tribal life also allows for a crude caste system to erupt from the goblin's chaotic politics.  All goblins have something to offer to the tribe, be they foragers, slavers, or warriors.  If they cannot contribute, they die.</p>\n<p><strong>We Live in a Society. </strong> Capricious to the last, goblins crave nothing more than power and domination of all others around them by any means (including those methods dangerous to the goblin).  Those goblins who possess enough might or cleverness may ascend to the rank of Goblin Boss and command a lair consisting of several dozens goblinoid fellows.  Should ambition prove overwhelming, the boss in rare cases may subjugate nearby lairs of rival goblinoids and crown themselves a Goblin Queen/King.  It has been documented that in one particular case, Queen Greld the Gutripper was able to enslave a camp containing hundreds of orcs, then laid siege to the city of Westerholt close by and sacked the entire city.</p>\n<p><strong>Gnash and Bite, Trick and Trap.</strong> Goblins maintain some of the most chaotic lairs within the known world, and to accomplish this the goblins require a plethora of slaves.  Not always willing to murder those they plunder, goblins and their kin are known slavers, spiriting away captured humans from merchant wagons to contruct their insidious dungeons.  WIthin a goblin lair is all manner of trap: tunnels leading nowhere, narrow passages no human could pass through, arrow slits, pits lined with spikes, and of course a multitude of alarms to warn the tribe of any impending danger.  Goblins utilize chaotic placement within their lairs to throw off intruders from their hard earned loot which is kept safe within the lair's heart.</p>\n<p><strong>And They Dance About the Flames.</strong> Goblins, though commonly thought of as greedy and stupid, leave their chaotic tendancies behind when it comes to the structure of religious worship.  They are beholden in particular to The God of the Goblins, also called They Who Lurk Beneath, who acts as chief of all other gods to the goblinoids.  This god encourages acts of violence, blind cruelty, enslaving others, as well as war amongst the enemies of the goblins.  Goblin tribes will join together in times of worship to dance, perform rituals with blood and bone, build massive bonfires, and sew chaos throughout the lair all in devotion to their evil benefactor.  Goblins, fueled by the spirit of the revelry, will then be exceedingly aggressive and volatile for the days after, raging through the surrounding area to sate the thirst of their cruel god.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry

The ebony feathered bird reaches height of nearly two and a half feet tall and bears a thick, dark beak which is perfectly utilized in its scavenging diet of carrion, unattended grains, and insects. However, something truly special lurks behind the dark abyss of this bird's eyes. Should you be prepared, adventurer, the effort put into training the raven will be given back tenfold.</p>\n<p><strong>Musings and Mimicry.</strong> Ravens are unique specimens among birds; by listening intently and practicing often the raven is able to mimic sounds it hears perfectly. From noises of forest animals to the precise timbre of their master's call, ravens are among the most seamless mimics to be found in the animal kingdom. Truly adventurer, the possibilities to employ the raven's mimicry are nearly limitless! You may see another example of this perfect mimicry in a larger cousin to this bird as well: the humanoid Kenku. Raven-like in form these little humanoids share the feathers and large beaks of their brethren, as well as their ability to copy the sounds of the world around them. Consider a second listen when you hear a voice but cannot place its location, for perhaps the raven speaks from the rafters above you, upon a midnight dreary.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by

Commoners come in all races, social classes, professions, and personalities. Be they a sly Dragonborn merchant, a boisterous Human tavern owner, or an elvish glassblower of supreme skills, the commoner befits those often outside the nobility. Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world. A commoner may be found wherever humanoids exist: cities, villages, out on the roads, forests, mountains, anywhere that has felt the touch of humanoids you may find a commoner there.</p>\n<p><strong>Power to the Proletariat.</strong> A certain fact about commoners is that they are often more average citizens of our world. They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls. This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own. Beware, adventurers, for even a seemingly simple commoner can fight dirty and surprise a seasoned fighter. However, a majority of commoners are less skilled in the martial arts, so do not be surprised if they reach for uncommon weapons to defend themselves including: clubs, broken bottles, chairs, barrels, stones, and cookware. Be they within a city or out on the open trail, it is always wise to maintain peace with the common-folk, for they may hide a set of skills or clever information that lies deep below their simple

The cat proves time and time again to be a prized companion whether they are keeping your property free of unwanted pests or cuddling up upon their master's lap for a cozy night within the study. Found in a number of varieties from the pure black short-haired cats associated with ill omens to the fluffy coated and absurdly flat-faced cats of the frozen north, there appears to be limitless breeds to select from. (Author's Note: I have recently heard rumor of a cat which produces no hair, requiring its master to simply stroke its flesh without pleasant barriers. More evidence forthcoming of this unfounded discovery). However, our feline compatriots have much more to offer when looked at under the shrewd eye of the adventurer!</p>\n<p><strong>Purrfect Pals.</strong> Be it at the side of the elder potion-maker tucked safely away in their shop or out with the upstart young ranger braving the rolling fields of the hinterlands, cats are found dotted all across our marvelous land. Compact and light in weight, these agile little hunters fit perfectly atop one's shoulder or nestled within a wagon's goods. Cats provide useful utility to the crafty conjurer who binds their familiar to such a form as well; with honed claws able to retract in a lighting's flash back into their paws the cat makes for a deadly hunter against smaller beasts. Cats also have a flexible spine allowing them to squeeze into difficult to reach places should you coax them adequately or even survive a perilous fall. Researchers have discovered that cats seem to have the uncanny ability to land upon their feet regardless of the angle at which they are dropped; surely this is an astonishing advantage over other less agile creatures! Deathly quiet (unless they prefer to pester their master for tasty morsels with a noisome yowl) a cat is an adequate infiltrator should one prefer to observe their surroundings from a safer distance through this familiar's eyes. Be they conjured or corporeal, it is this author's opinion that the common cat is a companion of quality and should be considered when seeking the appropriate animal ally.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token

The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath.

The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial.

What makes the cultist so fascinating is that they often attempt to blend seamlessly in with common folk: the barkeep at your favorite tavern, the guard near the gate, or even the dancer upon the stage may all be part of an underground community based ostensibly in evil. Now, to be clear, I do not encourage paranoia as cult activity is relatively rare in comparison to other, more immediate threats to our world; however, should a clever adventurer keep a keen eye out for secretive motions or gestures, odd symbols or markings, and even whispered code words, they can be certain they have stumbled into the workings of a cult. Quite commonly cultists align themselves with an ancient power trapped or dormant somewhere upon one of the more foul planes of existence. Their goals with this dark, godly force are myriad but often include control of a political structure, the deaths of hundreds if not thousands, or simply to sew despair and chaos across the realms of mortals. Unlike the desperate and cowardly bandits pushed to the brink by circumstance, cultists are often irredeemable foes. These men and women have been programed, brain-washed, or even directly controlled by their benefactor into the ways of darkness; often they are unfortunately unable to return to society once they have ingratiated themselves too deeply within the cult's network. Cults should always be handled and broken up with the utmost care; though the humanoid pawns behind the cult can be more easily dealt with, it should be remembered that cosmically evil forces may be at work and already set well into motion behind those pawns.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope

Here we will view the commonalities of what would be considered the “bandit” class of criminal. Be advised while reviewing this information that not all bandits should be viewed with a scornful eye. While many seek harm or riches from their quarry, others thieve to survive in a world most unfair.</p>\n<p><strong>The Good.</strong> We begin with those bandits who could be seen as “noble criminals”. These bandits consist of the most downtrodden of our nations, those citizens who have struggled through poverty and oppression to scrape out a meager existence clinging to any comfort they can grasp. Consider what would drive a person to commit something so desperate as robbery or open theft in a village street. Bandits of a nobler sort may still be selfish with their earnings, taking what they have stolen to enrich their own lives or those of immediate relations. There are some bandits, however, who seek to use their pilfered goods to improve the lives of the poorer community. Be aware that often these bandits are desperate and afraid, especially during the act of robbery. They are scared, driven to crime by poor circumstances, so they may not require violence to disperse as more often than not they will not physically harm their victims. Keep an open mind as you travel through the world young adventurer and remember that were the tables turned, you may wish for mercy for such a minor infraction.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bad and Ugly.</strong> For every good-hearted soul stealing from those with too much and giving to the unfortunate, there is a truly villainous spirit lurking behind the brush of a nearby road, lying in wait for an unsuspecting victim. During your travels, adventurer, these sorts may be the most common instances of banditry you will experience. Armed with swords, clubs, and bows, the more nefarious of the bandit world prefer to ambush their prey from the shadows of hills and trees, catching traveling parties unaware. These treacherous thieves will attempt diversion and trickery in order to catch their quarry off guard should their crew be outnumbered. Bandits have no boundaries of borders or locale, so caution should be taken whether you walk upon a forested road or sail the high seas as you island hop for fame. Danger lurks in every corner of our world adventurer, be prepared and discerning should you encounter a party of brigands lest your career end well before your legend is

The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial.

Dwellers of the coastal urban sprawl see the armored law keepers near daily as they patrol the streets, guard our gates, inspect shipments, and of course assist (or arrest) those citizens of their fair cities. However, the guard is not only bound by the gates and ramparts of a city's walls. Be they mercenary or professional, guards are often found patrolling the roads, either to sweep away stray packs of animals or bandits, or on alert to protect precious cargo or important citizens as they travel the less settled areas of the world. Much like the bandits and cultists who we have previously discussed in this tome, guards come in all varieties. Though many may seem to be highly trained and regimented, it should be considered that most guards see no more action than a tussle on the busy streets of a market or scattering a few bandit scavengers from an upturned wagon. Guards are not all the hardened and grizzled ex-military types we think of at the upper ranks of the orders. Be observant, young adventurer, and heed the warnings of the law, for while the guards may only be a minor threat to your dastardly visions, what lays in wait in the city dungeon may not be worth the risks!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any

These hardy ruminant beasts ranging from four and a half to nearly seven feet in height and subsist primarily upon the leaves of the forest floor and plants of the plains. Deer present with noticeable sexual dimorphism; the males or “bucks” brandish large multi-pronged racks of antlers upon their heads which they shed and regrow annually. Female deer, or “does”, lack the antlers of their male counterparts but are no less hardy when it comes to defending their herds.</p>\n<p><strong>Oh Deer, oh Deer</strong>. Deer are commonly docile creatures who will often flee at the first sight of any humanoid wandering into their domain. However, should you be unfortunate enough to encounter a buck during their mating season, you should consider taking a different path. Male deer's antlers can easily pierce weaker armor and flesh, tearing through a body as easily as a spear. Should you walk too close to a doe's precious children (or fawns) you will most assuredly experience the taste of the mother's hardened hooves upon you packing an uncanny amount of force for such nimble frames. Deer, when an adventurer's survival is considered, are best hunted from a distance to avoid these vicious melee defenses. The deer's meat, called “venison”, is mildly gamey though tasty and filling all the same, and the beasts' hides can be used for warmth or shelter in times of great need.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token

You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.</p><p><strong>Similar Area</strong>. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.</p><p><strong>Mishap</strong>. The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey.

I still have the damnable sting blisters from their catapults. WASPS! WHAT CREATURE PUTS WASPS IN BAGS AND THROWS THEM AT YOU?! Next Kobold I see I'm turning to paste…\"<br />- Guard Captain Nathaniel Greenbow, interviewed for this bestiary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Kobolds are conniving, cowardly humanoids of a reptilian appearance who infest the dungeons, catacombs, and caverns of our world. Appearing as tiny dragonoids with scaled flesh and crocodile-like snouts, Kobolds are perhaps more clever than their outward appearance would lead one to believe. Within their tiny heads (as the creatures stand no more than two and a half feet tall) lies a brain churning with myriad ideas, though many include idiotically dangerous schemes. It is not uncommon for many Kobolds to perish before their first complete decade of life.</p>\n<p><strong>Mob Mentality.</strong> Kobolds, much like rodents, breed at an astonishingly quick rate as compared to other humanoid species. Egg-layers like their draconic kin, Kobolds mature rapidly upon emerging from their shells, and assume their place within the ranks of their chittering society. Even upon reaching maturity, however, the Kobold is still a weak creature causing the colonies to stick together when exploring or hunting. Though Kobolds may defeat larger foes with sheer numbers, it is often at the cost of massive casualties on the Kobold's side. This, of course, hardly deters the resentful Kobolds, who have more eggs incubating away with the next infantry reinforcements just moments away from joining the fold.</p>\n<p><strong>Launch the Centipult.</strong> Stupid yet clever, Kobolds truly excel at two things: burrow-making and creating traps for unwary adventurers. Traps, of course, are the Kobold's speciality and they take relish in littering their lairs with copious defenses hewn from the natural resources of their home. Perhaps crushing logs were torn from the rafter struts of an abandoned temple, or carnivorous insects were placed into dropping ceramic pots to smash down upon foolish intruders. Never underestimate the ability of a Kobold to find some unsuspected way to impede your progress.</p>\n<p><strong>Trade Offs.</strong> Though strong in numbers, Kobolds may be defeated in several ways. Firstly, the creatures are born and mature within near total darkness, thus the sun weakens them and blinds their sensitive eyes. Kobolds are also nigh defenseless without the aid of their allies at their backs; often a lone Kobold with attempt to scurry away should they be caught out without their pack. Greedy and determined when it comes to self-preservation, Kobolds may be easily manipulated with smooth talk or a shiny trinket to line their pockets. Draconic in nature as well, the scuttling dragonoids can be used as crude translators of the dragon's tongue should you require such services on your journey.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by

Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world. A commoner may be found wherever humanoids exist: cities, villages, out on the roads, forests, mountains, anywhere that has felt the touch of humanoids you may find a commoner there.</p>\n<p><strong>Power to the Proletariat.</strong> A certain fact about commoners is that they are often more average citizens of our world. They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls. This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own. Beware, adventurers, for even a seemingly simple commoner can fight dirty and surprise a seasoned fighter. However, a majority of commoners are less skilled in the martial arts, so do not be surprised if they reach for uncommon weapons to defend themselves including: clubs, broken bottles, chairs, barrels, stones, and cookware. Be they within a city or out on the open trail, it is always wise to maintain peace with the common-folk, for they may hide a set of skills or clever information that lies deep below their simple

You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.</p><p>You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature's memory isn't altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.</p><p>A modified memory doesn't necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature's natural inclinations, Alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The DM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.</p><p>A Remove Curse or Greater Restoration spell cast on the target restores the creature's true memory.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels</strong>. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can alter the target's memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creature's past (9th level).</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB pg. 261","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":1,"units":"minute"},"cover":null,"target":{"value":1,"width":null,"units":"","type":"creature"},"range":{"value":30,"long":0,"units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":0,"max":"0","per":"","recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"save","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":"","value":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"wis","dc":0,"scaling":"spell"},"level":5,"school":"enc","components":{"vocal":true,"somatic":true,"material":false,"ritual":false,"concentration":true,"value":""},"materials":{"value":"","consumed":false,"cost":0,"supply":0},"preparation":{"mode":"prepared","prepared":true},"scaling":{"mode":"level","formula":""}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.spells.r3243JU4AyQJyfX4"}},"img":"icons/magic/air/air-burst-spiral-large-teal-green.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1661787234232,"modifiedTime":1671732001745,"lastModifiedBy":"8pEKuxhCYVCDuXDE"}},{"_id":"vmhRnIUZ0pnhbS3y","name":"Dominate Person","ownership":{"default":0,"8pEKuxhCYVCDuXDE":3},"type":"spell","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>You attempt to beguile a humanoid that you can see within range.
