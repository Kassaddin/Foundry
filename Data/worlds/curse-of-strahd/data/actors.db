paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.sZ86mbX8D5PfYuhl]{Oath of Devotion}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"SRD 5.1","identifier":"paladin","levels":5,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"z2d0fxi8e24gradq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"1yiWzEZJCyqyd9o2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","ibgSHZI9sS8r3Wtd":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"}},"level":1,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"xy3wlxtiwbplsms7","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.Ho7dVxBlOYFlfBHk","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"ulp430qaVPLKoAp5":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.Ho7dVxBlOYFlfBHk","KQEGwlPSPDm3eTki":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","lPVfClhvTgpRYF0L":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"}},"level":2,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"v26vmuy5lpsu5g4c","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.8M7uOPhbTxoxxJSo"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"ddXWThRD0XRvx9fq":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","60R1SMgeYRA4eZKE":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC","EnWlJ8xGWXgvqMXF":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.8M7uOPhbTxoxxJSo"}},"level":3,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"m3ytemj4ygib8c5m","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"3bB8WnlFhrBX7jSi":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"}},"level":5,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"w3n62vbfeo3c7a90","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":6,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"ers71klsl2dcjpfa","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":10,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"kxodggik4e56u85t","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":11,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"3x1u7nnxv8ftkt0d","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":14,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"ebo3padd7vg4jg3g","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":6,"3":10,"4":4,"5":5},"title":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"cha"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"8pEKuxhCYVCDuXDE":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.gZiUvbXWLs0pOp0c"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1661787234280,"modifiedTime":1682012747709,"lastModifiedBy":"8pEKuxhCYVCDuXDE"}},{"_id":"1yiWzEZJCyqyd9o2","name":"Divine Sense","ownership":{"default":0,"8pEKuxhCYVCDuXDE":3},"type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.

druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.</p>\n<p>Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.</p>\n<p>Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.</p>\n<h3>Druids and the Gods</h3>\n<p>Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.udVPA9JW5wy5t3G5]{Appendix B} include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples.</p>\n<h1>Druid Circles</h1>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.4Ae2SPZRXEVbVs0M]{Circle of the Land}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"SRD 5.1","identifier":"druid","levels":2,"hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"qv0gbr1rb5889ubd","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":8,"2":"avg"},"title":""},{"_id":"6pdotglp4hy4zlvb","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.LzJ5ayHt0OlSVGxi","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.i6tPm3FNK13Ftc9v"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"eEvu7KHlsi9usTIn":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.LzJ5ayHt0OlSVGxi","SbB9thOwsZPUymLN":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.i6tPm3FNK13Ftc9v"}},"level":1,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"qnfy6m18u4cfdqwm","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.swK0r5TOIxredxWS","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.u6Du2P9s81SWuGbi"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"2lYoYbL3zhtdamTR":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.swK0r5TOIxredxWS","BLe8OF2zsqiwBiJF":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.u6Du2P9s81SWuGbi"}},"level":2,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"r3xhzsz7noff50w3","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.cVDEQo0ow1WJT7Wl","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.xvgPu1O57DgXCM86"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":18,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"pkfb1a2u37665epq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ip4bvmGoz3qkoqes"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":20,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"6vytnom37pkazgld","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"wild-shape","type":"cr","scale":{"2":{"value":0.25},"4":{"value":0.5},"8":{"value":1}},"distance":{"units":""}},"value":{},"title":"Wild Shape CR"},{"_id":"K8ShWezgK90dp1uk","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"cantrips-known","type":"number","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"1":{"value":2},"4":{"value":3},"10":{"value":4}}},"value":{},"title":"Cantrips Known"}],"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","ani","ins","med","nat","prc","rel","sur"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"wis"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"8pEKuxhCYVCDuXDE":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.ygVYgPbJkaH0tH1N"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1661787234284,"modifiedTime":1682012369910,"lastModifiedBy":"8pEKuxhCYVCDuXDE"}},{"_id":"eEvu7KHlsi9usTIn","name":"Druidic","ownership":{"default":0,"8pEKuxhCYVCDuXDE":3},"type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>You know Druidic, the secret language of druids.

Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<h5>Ritual Casting</h5>\n<p>You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\n<h5>Spellcasting Focus</h5>\n<p>You can use a druidic focus (see @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.BYFd9hiJGo9L5aOM.JournalEntryPage.AjavRU4yPfI9hfaI]{Adventuring Gear}) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"SRD 5.1","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"class","subtype":""},"requirements":"Druid 1","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.i6tPm3FNK13Ftc9v","advancementOrigin":"maA2RL4zBgM1utlq.6pdotglp4hy4zlvb"}},"img":"icons/magic/light/orb-beams-green.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1661787234409,"modifiedTime":1682012363202,"lastModifiedBy":"8pEKuxhCYVCDuXDE"}},{"_id":"2lYoYbL3zhtdamTR","name":"Wild Shape","ownership":{"default":0,"8pEKuxhCYVCDuXDE":3},"type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before.

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>\n<p>While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"SRD 5.1","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"floor(@classes.druid.levels / 2)","units":"hour"},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":"self"},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":"self"},"uses":{"value":2,"max":"@classes.druid.levels > 19 ? 99 : 2","per":"sr","recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"class","subtype":""},"requirements":"Druid 2","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.swK0r5TOIxredxWS","advancementOrigin":"maA2RL4zBgM1utlq.qnfy6m18u4cfdqwm"}},"img":"icons/creatures/mammals/elk-moose-marked-green.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1661787234433,"modifiedTime":1682012369901,"lastModifiedBy":"8pEKuxhCYVCDuXDE"}},{"_id":"BLe8OF2zsqiwBiJF","name":"Druid Circle","ownership":{"default":0,"8pEKuxhCYVCDuXDE":3},"type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids, such as the Circle of the Land.</p><p>Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"SRD 5.1","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"class","subtype":""},"requirements":"Druid 2","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.u6Du2P9s81SWuGbi","advancementOrigin":"maA2RL4zBgM1utlq.qnfy6m18u4cfdqwm"},"magicitems":{"enabled":false,"equipped":false,"attuned":false,"charges":"0","chargeType":"c1","destroy":false,"destroyFlavorText":"reaches 0 charges: it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","rechargeable":false,"recharge":"0","rechargeType":"t1","rechargeUnit":"r1","sorting":"l"}},"img":"icons/magic/nature/tree-roots-glow-yellow.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1661787234435,"modifiedTime":1682012378137,"lastModifiedBy":"8pEKuxhCYVCDuXDE"}},{"_id":"uMIr3RSm8mWGsHeh","name":"Bearkin","type":"feat","flags":{"betterRolls5e":{"critRange":{"type":"String","value":""},"critDamage":{"type":"String","value":""},"quickDesc":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true},"quickAttack":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true},"quickSave":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true},"quickDamage":{"type":"Array","value":[],"altValue":[],"context":[]},"quickProperties":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true},"quickCharges":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true},"quickTemplate":{"type":"Boolean","value":false,"altValue":false},"quickOther":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true,"context":""},"quickFlavor":{"type":"Boolean","value":true,"altValue":true}},"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":true,"effects":[{"modSpecKey":"data.traits.languages.value","value":"common","mode":"+","targetSpecific":false,"id":1,"itemId":"pcIyzDXQ1tg2JMnl","active":false,"_targets":[],"label":"Traits Language"},{"modSpecKey":"data.traits.languages.custom","value":"Bearic","mode":"+","targetSpecific":false,"id":2,"itemId":"pcIyzDXQ1tg2JMnl","active":false,"_targets":[],"label":"Traits Language Custom"},{"modSpecKey":"data.skills.sur.value","value":"1","mode":"+","targetSpecific":false,"id":3,"itemId":"pcIyzDXQ1tg2JMnl","active":false,"_targets":[],"label":"Skills Survival"}]},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.SupersHomebrewPack.races.AMrQoYkTjyZr4px8"},"magicitems":{"enabled":false,"equipped":false,"attuned":false,"charges":"0","chargeType":"c1","destroy":false,"destroyFlavorText":"reaches 0 charges: it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","rechargeable":false,"recharge":"0","rechargeType":"t1","rechargeUnit":"r1","sorting":"l"}},"img":"icons/creatures/abilities/bear-roar-bite-brown.webp","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2><span style=\"color:#782e22;font-family:Andada, serif\"><span style=\"font-variant-caps:small-caps\">Bearkin</span></span></h2>\n<p>Strong, stubborn, and powerful, bearkin are a race of tribal warriors. The bipedla blood relative of their ursine ancestors, bearkin live in small tribes or clas of about a dozen deep in forests, caves, and sometimes arctic wastelands where they are able to hunt and kill their prey with vicious ferocity. Their use of weapons and keen battle sense give them an edge over their unevolved kin, and are often a formidable foe.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#782e22;font-family:Andada, serif;font-size:18.2px;font-variant-caps:small-caps\">Protective Nature<br /></span>Bearkin have strong parental instincts and are willing to fight to protect their clans and families. To a bearkin, blood is thicker than water, and few situations would result in a bearkin abandoning their clan and joining a life of adventure. Powerful and protective, they tend to be wary of outsiders but make very loyal allies, though they rarely side with larger kingdoms or armies due to their disinterest in politics.</p>\n<p>As strong in heart as in muscle, Bearkin have a strong natural parental instinct. In their families, both parents are expected to provide and care for their children (known as 'cubs') as best they can.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color:#782e22;font-family:Andada, serif\"><span style=\"font-size:18.2px;font-variant-caps:small-caps\">Tradition and Honor<br /></span></span>Traditionally, Bearkin tend not to be religious creatures, though all owe faith to Grizzus, their patron god of bears. While clans differ vastly in beliefs and ideals, all owe allegiance to Grizzus and his ideals of clan law and leadership.</p>\n<p>Tribes and families of Bearkin are often found fighting and feuding, although complex politics and many of the concepts of ownership, such as money, are unfamiliar customs to them.</p>\n<p>Grizzus, who Bearkin believe watches and guides them through play and battle, often contacts Elders of shamans within tribes as well as particularily righteous or powerful warriors. They claim to have seen visions of their god in their sleep designating them a specific task, and it is not uncommon for a member of the tribe to leave in pursuit of this mission, which is a sign of honor.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:#782e22;font-family:Andada, serif;font-size:18.2px;font-variant-caps:small-caps\"><span style=\"color:#782e22;font-family:Andada, serif\"><span style=\"font-size:18.2px;font-variant-caps:small-caps\">Bearkin Names<br /></span></span></span></span><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Bearkin names are derived from their grizzly origin, and therefore have strong sounds and syllables.

They also tend to favour a balance between the law of their clan and the chaotic nature of their lifestyle.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Size:</span> Bearkin tower over their companions at around 7 to 8 feet tall, and weigh anywhere from 300 to above 450 pounds. Your size is medium.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Speed:</span> Your base walking speed is<strong> 30 feet</strong>.</li>\n<li><u>Keen Smell:</u> You gain advantage on <strong>Wisdom (Perception) </strong>checks that rely on smell.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Animal Instincts:</span> You have proficiency in the <strong>Survival</strong> skill.</li>\n<li><u>Claws:</u> Using your bear claws to attack, your unarmed strikes deal [[/r 1d4]] <strong>slashing</strong> damage.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Languages:</span> You can speak, read, and write Common. In addition, you can speak Bearic. Bearic is a primitive language of growls and barks most often used to quickly convey details while hunting and to intimidate; it has no written form.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Subrace:</span> Differences in the backgrounds and locations of their environment have resulted in 5 different subraces of Bearkin: Black bears, Brown bears, Polar Bears, Pands Bears, and Koalas. Choose one of these subraces.\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Black Bear:</span> The smallest and most timid of the bearkin varieties, Black Bears tend to be smarter and make up clans of single families in caves or other underground locations, occasionally including the Underdark. They mostly keep to themselves and protect their lairs and territories without moving about, but will happily interact with others of their kind.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Ability Score Increase: </em>Your <strong>Wisdom </strong>score increases by 1.</li>\n<li><em>Darkvision: </em>Familiar with the darkness, you have superior darkvision in dark or dim conditions. You gain <strong>60 ft </strong>of darkvision.</li>\n<li><em>Stealthy: </em>You gain proficiency in the <strong>Stealth </strong>skill. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Brown Bear:</span> Fiercly protective, honorable, strong, and usually friendly to outsiders, the most common of the bearkin varieties have a strong protective instinct and make up large clans with a lax hierarchy. They often live nomadically, moving from forest to forest to cycle theyr prey and avoid retaliation from nearby developed settlements.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Ability Score Increase:</em> Your <strong>Charisma</strong> score increases by 1.</li>\n<li><em>Protector:</em> When an ally within <strong>10 ft </strong>of you must make a <strong>Strength saving throw</strong>, you may choose to have the effect target you in their place. This feature can only be used twice every short rest.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Polar Bear:</span> The rarest of the bearkin, polar bears have thick winter hides, tend to be very aggressive to outsiders and have very large territories. During harsh winters, Polar Bear tribes raid human settlements at their weakest for food and supplies, especially in colder regions, Polar Bears are usually regarded as hostile.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Ability Score Increase:</em> Your <strong>Constitution </strong>score increases by 1.</li>\n<li><em>Winter Hide:</em> You have resistance to <strong>cold</strong> damage. You are also able to weather much colder climates than other races.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Panda Bear:</span> Found in the Far East, Panda Bear tribes and customs are largely unknown and foreign, partly as a result of their rarity. As spiritual as their notorious appetit, they have a long history and a keen sense of wisdom, preferring to keep out of the eyes of civilized society.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Ability Score Increase:</em> Your <strong>Wisdom</strong> score increases by 1.</li>\n<li><em>Folk Healer:</em> You gain proficiency in the <strong>Medicine</strong> skill.</li>\n<li><em>Spiritual Communication:</em> You gain the ability to cast the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.2VXGS206tuChoeXy]{Speak with Plants} spell using your wisdom modifier. Using this feature, you are only able to communicate with the plants, not command, move, or control them. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until the end of a short rest. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Koala Bear:</span><em> </em>From distant lands to the untamed islands of the south, the connection of Koalas to the Bearkin lineage is often in dispute. They still carry the ferocity of the race however, despite their smaller size. Forming small nomadic communities in the trees in their notoriously hot and dangerous homeland, they drop from low-hanging branches to surprise and attack their prey which is often many times their size. The rumors of their cannibalistic nature are unfounded (though not entirely dismissed).\n<ul>\n<li><em>Ability Score Increase:</em> Your <strong>Dexterity </strong>score increases by 1.</li>\n<li><em>Size:</em> Koala bears are much smaller than their common relatives.
